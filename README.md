age.py takes a users name and age in 2021 as inputs, and prints a message telling the user the year in which they will turn 100
fact.py computes the factorial of an input value. The user specifies whether they are entering an int or a float, if an int is entered the factorial is calculated recursively and returned, if a float is entered as x then the gamma function of x+1 is approximated and returned as the factorial.
divcheck.py takes two integer inputs and computes input 1 modulo input 2. If the modulus is zero the program returns a message telling the user that input 1 is divisible by input 2 (in the case that input 2 = 2 the message is input 1 is even) and otherwise returns a message that input 1 is not divisible by input 2.
